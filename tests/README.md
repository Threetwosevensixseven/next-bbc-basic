A handful of BBC BASIC programs I use for regression and soak testing:

- assembler_Z80N.bbc: Test for Z80N instructions
- cube.bbc: Spinning 3D cube
- circle.bbc: Draw a filled in circle
- lines.bbc: Draw random lines
- triangles.bbc: Draw random triangles
- mandlebrot.bbc: Draw a Mandlebrot set
- hatgraph.bbc: A 3D graph
- sound.bbc: Tests the SOUND command, should play Amazing Grace
- fireworks.bbc: Tests colour palette animation in Mode 2
- shadows.bbc: Ray traced spheres
- sprites_nextreg.bbc: Test accessing the Next registers from BASIC
- ftest1.bbc: Read and output the file ftest.txt
- ftest2.bbc: Write to file ftest.txt
- ftest3.bbc: Append to file ftest.txt

And there are also a set of Rugg/Feldman (PCW) benchmark programs; benchm1.bbc to benchm8.bbc
