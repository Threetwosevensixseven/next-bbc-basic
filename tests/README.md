# tests

A handful of BBC BASIC programs I use for regression and soak testing:

- assembler_Z80N.bbc: Test for Z80N instructions
- cube.bbc: Spinning 3D cube
- circle.bbc: Draw a filled in circle
- mandlebrot.bbc: Draw a Mandlebrot set
- hatgraph.bbc: A 3D graph

And there are also a set of Rugg/Feldman (PCW) benchmark programs; benchm1.bbc to benchm8.bbc
